## Overview

**Project Title**: Word Guesser Game

**Project Description**: This is a simple word guessing game where the player guesses a word by filling in missing letters. The game will show a random word with blank spaces and the player has six lives to guess the correct letters. If the player guesses the wrong letter, they lose a life. The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of lives.

**Project Goals**: Create a working word guessing game with a simple text-based interface.
Implement a feature where the game gives feedback on incorrect guesses.
Add a feature to display a hanging image for each incorrect guess (like the classic hangman game).

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Run main.py 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the game from the terminal or IDE.
2. The game will prompt you to guess a letter.
3. Keep guessing letters until the word is fully revealed or you lose all your lives.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* No external libraries are required for this project (it only uses standard Python libraries).
*

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
* [ ] Implement a difficulty level system with shorter or longer words.
* [ ] Track and display the player's score across multiple games.
